Critical Designer, Activist Engineer: Making Things and Making Things Happen
Mondays and Thursdays, 1:30-3:10
AC 213

What happens when design and engineering research results in activism, human rights work, politics, or matters of equity and justice? Engineers and designers are often thought of as "problem-solvers" in mostly technical, practical, and formal senses. But this class explores the equally compelling history of engineering and design projects that raise difficult questions, aid marginalized communities, address urgent social issues, or create new conditions. We'll talk to designers, artists, and engineers who work on issues of sustainability, power, health, education, and more. And we'll run our own experiments in creative design work for the public good. The class includes significant reading, field trips and lectures, short experiments, and a culminating project.
