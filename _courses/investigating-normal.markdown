subhead: Investigating Normal is a critical disability studies seminar housed in a
  design-build studio. First created at Rhode Island School of Design in 2013, the
  course is for engineers and designers to solve problems, when they're presented
  as such, and to ask questions—about normalcy, ability, cultural ideas of the body,
  and more. Fall 2016 at Olin College marks its fourth session.

## Course Overview

Assistive technologies usually refer to prosthetics and medical aids: tools, devices, and other gear that either restore or augment the functioning of body parts. Historically, these have been designed for people with diagnosable disabilities. In this course, we look at medical as well as cultural tools that investigate the “normal” body and mind, and we design our own devices—high-tech, low-tech, digital or analog—with these ideas in mind. Through readings, site visits, guest speakers, and projects, we investigate both traditional and unusual prosthetics and assistive technologies, broadly defined. We talk to end-users, to engineers and industrial designers, to artists, and to others whose technologies assist with visible and invisible needs, externalize hidden dynamics, and create capacities far beyond or outside ordinary functionality.

Key to our discussions will be the implicit and explicit narratives that get created by and with prosthetic technologies. We'll look at popular prosthetic tools and examine how their users "perform" them, keeping economic and socio-political factors in mind. We'll also investigate the ways these narratives get lumped together or distinguished from the available and popular cultural narratives about the cyborg self, about human-machine interfaces in general. With this analysis in mind, I'll ask you to consider new possibilities for manufacturable prosthetic and medical technologies in the interest of better _treatment_, especially if that's where your personal interest lies. But I'll also ask you to engage in what's been called [interrogative design](http://www.interrogative.org/about/), or [critical design](http://www.dunneandraby.co.uk/content/biography), or [resonant design](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Meets-Disability-Graham-Pullin/dp/0262516748/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1379087649&sr=8-1&keywords=design+meets+disability): that is, problem _finding_ as well as problem _solving_; suspending questions by pressing together, in one artifact or set of artifacts, seemingly disparate or opposing ideas; thinking about what Anthony Dunne calls "para-functionality": design that lives among recognizable realms of utility, but expands, as he says, beyond conventional definitions of functionalism to include the poetic, or activist, or socio-political.

The class themes are heterogeneous in the first half of the course—on purpose. With visitors and projects and readings, we'll jump quickly between and among high-tech, low-tech, practical and impractical tools and wearables. The idea is to have you exposed to as many dispositions for making your projects as possible. This "field" is very wide indeed, and its generativity is still under-recognized. Be ready for some zigs and zags along the way, but the goal is to help you elicit your _own_ questions as potential engineers in this broad research space.

It's worth mentioning right up front that you should divest yourself of the common and well-intended but *utterly misguided* earnestness that drives many designers' assumptions about "assistive technology." It may be tempting to find some technical novelty or functional gadget and then, only afterward, look for an application "for the disabled." I've seen too many projects in this vein lately.

Be aware, first, that a central tenet of this class is that [_all_ technology is assistive technology](https://medium.com/backchannel/all-technology-is-assistive-ac9f7183c8cd): No matter what kind of body you inhabit, you are getting assistance from your devices and extensions and proxies every single day. And second, gird yourself with a proper humility: Ask lots of questions, do the research on precedent tools, and respect the stunning sensory organism that is the living, breathing, adaptive human body. White canes, ankle braces, and assistance animals, after all, are extraordinarily sophisticated prostheses. Digital tools offer unique capabilities, yes—but they're not inherently "smart" because of their digital nature. The point here is to see ability and disability as an exciting, expansive lens with which to think about many bodies and many kinds of needs.

Finally: This video with Judith Butler and Sunaura Taylor is a kind of manifesto, a solid frame from which the ethos of the course proceeds. Please watch early and often:

## Basics

Please let me know in advance if you absolutely must be absent, either day or night. Missing more than one class will significantly affect your evaluation.

***

## Course Components

**Short experiments**: We'll work together in teams—once or twice in class, and once or twice on your own—on some short exercises to jumpstart the making process.

**Weekly readings/viewings**: See each week's required and suggested readings.

**Final projects**: At the beginning of October, all students will self-assess both skills and interests, and we'll line up teams to match with client collaborators accordingly.

**Experimental context**: The class has an ambitious scope in this first few iterations at Olin; that's because we're trying out several possible partnerships for the long term of the class and the [adaptation + ability group](http://ablersite.org/2014/08/20/guiding-principles-for-an-adaptive-technology-working-group/). Be flexible! Some readings may change; some class time arrangements may change. I'm interested in being responsive to the particular direction of this group.

## Inclusion Statement

It is Olin College’s policy to comply fully with all state and federal disability laws. Olin does not discriminate against applicants or students with disabilities, and will consider modification to academic programs where necessary to ensure that our requirements are not discriminatory, as long as the modifications do not fundamentally alter the nature of our programs. The Office of Student Life coordinates services for students with learning disabilities, sensory impairments, psychological disabilities and medical conditions. Students are responsible for identifying themselves to the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising and providing appropriate documentation of their disability and need for accommodation in a timely manner. Students requesting accommodation should contact the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Advising as soon as possible after matriculation.

Services for students with learning disabilities may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, coaching on organizational and time management skills, faculty notification and academic advising. Services for students with physical, sensory, or psychological impairments as well as medical conditions may include, but are not limited to, academic accommodations, assistance with adaptive technology, accessibility accommodations and academic advising. Any specific modifications granted will be based on detailed discussions with each student about their particular situation, and on information from a medical care provider concerning the student’s disability and related needs.

I assume that all of us learn in different ways, and that the organization of any course will accommodate each student differently. Please talk to me as soon as you can about your individual learning needs and how this course can best accommodate them. Even if you do not have a documented disability, remember that other support services are available to all students.
