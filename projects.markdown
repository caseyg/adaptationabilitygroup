welcome-text: The Adaptation \+ Ability Group is a lab for creative research on technology
  and the body at Olin College. Projects may get their start through the "test kitchen"
  of Sara Hendren's course for undergraduates, Investigating Normal, or stand alone
  as ongoing collaborations. We've worked with dancers, engineers, artists, and retirees,
  but also with schools and non-profits.
