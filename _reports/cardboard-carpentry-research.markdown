[Lauren Froschauer](http://adaptivedesignstudyolincollege.blogspot.com/) (Olin '16) was part of Investigating Normal in its spring 2015 class, during which [Adaptive Design Association](http://www.adaptivedesign.org/) (ADA) director Alex Truesdell came to campus to introduce students to the wonders of cardboard carpentry. The ADA is an offshoot of [Perkins School for the Blind](http://www.perkins.org/); both organizations have been building free, customized furniture for decades. (Read more about our lab's practice as a satellite site for ADA work [here](http://aplusa.org/projects/cardboard-carpentry-with-adaptive-design-association/).)

Lauren took an intensive workshop at ADA in New York and subsequently trained students at Olin. She also did an independent study at Perkins with Molly Campbell, who runs the [Assistive Device Center](http://www.perkins.org/services/other/assistive-device-center) there. She blogged about her experiences, and we're happy to say that she's built a relationship with a local elementary school near Olin as a partnership for co-designing these devices in our community. Below are some images from Lauren's research; a report is coming soon. See [her site here](http://adaptivedesignstudyolincollege.blogspot.com/).
