[Lauren Froschauer](http://adaptivedesignstudyolincollege.blogspot.com/) (Olin '16) was part of Investigating Normal in its spring 2015 class, during which [Adaptive Design Association](http://www.adaptivedesign.org/) (ADA) director Alex Truesdell came to campus to introduce students to the wonders of cardboard carpentry. The ADA is an offshoot of [Perkins School for the Blind](http://www.perkins.org/); both organizations have been building free, customized furniture for decades. (Read more about our lab's practice as a satellite site for ADA work here.)

Lauren took an intensive workshop at ADA in New York and subsequently trained students at Olin. She also did an independent study at Perkins with Molly Campbell, who runs the [Assistive Device Center](http://www.perkins.org/services/other/assistive-device-center) there. She blogged about her experiences, and we're happy to say that she's built a relationship with a local elementary school near Olin as a partnership for co-designing these devices for our local community in the future. Below are some images from Lauren's research. See [her site here](http://adaptivedesignstudyolincollege.blogspot.com/).
