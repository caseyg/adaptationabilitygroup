In Investigating Normal, spring '15, a team of students documented some how-to basics for cardboard carpentry, part of our work with the [Adaptive Design Association](http://aplusa.org/projects/cardboard-carpentry-with-adaptive-design-association/). Coming soon is a report on how they made shot, edited, and produced a short video to make this practice accessible to a wider audience of potential makers, and how they designed a set of posters with some key basics, intended for classrooms or workshops. More to come!
