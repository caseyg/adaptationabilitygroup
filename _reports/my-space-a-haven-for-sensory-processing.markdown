In the spirit of [our work with the Adaptive Design Association](http://aplusa.org/projects/low-tech-engineering-adaptive-design-association/), students in the spring 2015 class worked with the [Walker School](http://www.walkercares.org/) in Needham to design some low tech adaptive furniture. Walker teachers told the team about their needs for some kind of coverings for classroom chairs to make them sensory havensâ€”spaces of protection and calm, without possibility for injury. Like a private cave as a respite, with simple materials. They wanted something in the spirit of a library carrel without the potential to cause harm with its heft and edges.

They're designed for students who have sensory processing disorders that may result from psycho-social challenges or atypicality on the autism spectrum. Students iterated through a number of possibilities, eventually arriving at this felt model:

The final prototype packed up easily for portability and was made for easy replication: commonly available craft materials and simple fabrication techniques.
