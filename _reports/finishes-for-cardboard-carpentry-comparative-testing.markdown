A report by David Pudlo '15 on the sustainability of various cardboard finishes, part of our work with the Adaptive Design Association, coming soon! Here's a look at some finishes he tested, including beeswax, linseed oil, kapton tape, and more. Remarks from David follow the images. —Sara

The initial inquiry for this study, inspired by the work of the Adaptive Design Association, came about because there seemed to be a dearth of documented options for sealing cardboard that were well aligned with its strengths as a design material (cheap, accessible, environmentally friendly, easy to work with) and also helped with the weaknesses of cardboard (strength, durability, water resistance, aesthetics). There was paint/polyurethane, but that's about all I found.

Goals for the experimental coatings were to make it more durable, water resistant/proof, and beautiful. Other criteria to evaluate options would include cost, environmental impact, health impact (fumes + such from offgassing), ease and cost of application, and aesthetics.

Coatings selected were meant to be mostly things available from a standard hardware store with an eye towards the natural. I tried a few wood finishing options (these included linseed oil, beeswax, shellac, wood glue, paint, and polyurethane). A few tapes were tried (painters, kapton)—I should have documented packing tape because I've found it awesome in making other cardboard things in my life), as well as wheatpaste and wheatpaste with papers. 

Some thoughts on this testing: Wood glue was a surprising favorite: easy to find, cheap(ish), easy to apply, looks great (keeps natural tones), and seems durable and good with water. I'd need to look into its complete environmental impact. Beeswax was great but a bit difficult to work with but better methods could be figured out. 

Next steps would be to run some scratch and water tests, then compile a nice table/report with all those criteria listed.
