In fall 2015, artist Carmen Papalia came for what's known at Olin as a "micro-residency"—a visit of several days that included an artist's talk, meetings with students, class visits, and more.

Carmen says he's a non-visual learner; he uses a cane and smart phone to navigate the built environment. His work has included lots of performance projects that utterly subvert the normative cultural expectations for an assistive cane.

Carmen told us about these precedent works and the context of his practice in general, which is social, durational, and sometimes collaborative. His work engages alternate sensory worlds and modes of access, broadly conceived. And he does it with such humor and irreverence.

After his talk, Carmen led us on a "blind field shuttle"—a collaborative work he's performed before. It's not a simulation of blindness, and certainly not an "empathy exercise."
