In fall 2015, artist Carmen Papalia came for what's known at Olin as a "micro-residency"—a visit of several days that included an artist's talk, meetings with students, class visits, and more.

Carmen says he's a non-visual learner; he uses a cane and smart phone to navigate the built environment. His work has included lots of performance projects that utterly subvert the normative cultural expectations for an assistive cane. Like working with a marching band to perform instructions for a convivial audio [form of navigation](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-ouch-31749643).

Carmen told us about these precedent works and the context of his practice in general, which is social, durational, and theatrical. His work engages alternate sensory worlds and modes of access, broadly conceived. And he does it with such humor and irreverence.

After his talk, Carmen led us on a "blind field shuttle"—a collaborative work he's performed before. It's not a simulation of blindness, and certainly not an "empathy exercise." It's something else entirely: an hour walking, eyes closed, and interdependent on the person in front of you and the person behind you. We walked with one hand on the shoulder of the next person in line, and we provided a shoulder for the one after. Once you settle into the feeling, it's blissful: an invitation to feel the sun on your face, to attend to the sounds and somatic changes of the environment. It's an alternate form of experience, no more and no less.

He also invited students to perform a solo walk, unsighted. Now we weren't connected to anyone else, and we confronted our relative willingness to explore unsighted. Again, not to "experience blindness"—not at all—but to engage in an alternate sensory world.
