[Engineering at Home](http://engineeringathome.org/) is an unusual archive that catalogs one woman's adaptive gear, a collaboration between Cindy, a retiree in suburban Boston, and Sara Hendren and Caitrin Lynch, professors at Olin College. It's also a [manifesto](http://engineeringathome.org/manifesto), an open call for a more expansive and capacious definition of engineering. Below are some images from the project archive; you can read more on the project's [web site](http://engineeringathome.org/).
