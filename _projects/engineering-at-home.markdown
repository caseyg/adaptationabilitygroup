[Engineering at Home](http://engineeringathome.org/) is an unusual archive that catalogs one woman's adaptive gear, a collaboration between Cindy, a retiree in suburban Boston, and Sara Hendren and Caitrin Lynch, professors at Olin College. It's also a [manifesto](http://engineeringathome.org/manifesto), an open call for a more expansive and capacious definition of engineering. Below is an excerpt from the project's [essay](http://engineeringathome.org/manifesto) and some images from the project archive. You can read more on the project [web site](http://engineeringathome.org/).

"What do we learn from such a radically tailored engineering? Cindy’s story embodies the surprises and complexities of what happens in user-initiated design.* It’s something more than what’s popularly known as user-“centered” design or participatory design; it’s engineering that proceeds from the original wishes of a single end user. Perhaps especially in design for disability, attentive design-for-one practices can yield a powerful course correction to the top-down modes of manufacturing. A disposition of experimentation, a willingness to harvest the lessons of singularity, a provisional commitment to the one-off: these unique objects together form an argument for the recognition of more user-initiated technologies as engineering, wherever they originate and whatever market they may eventually find."
