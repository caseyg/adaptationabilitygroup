Chris Hinojosa, an engineer born with one arm, always refused the "universal" high-tech artificial limbs that were made for him growing up. His body was more adaptive without machinic gear; instead, his workarounds for daily life are made possible with relatively simple adaptations and alternately choreographed physicality. When he first visited Investigating Normal in spring 2015, he showed us how he gathers his hair into a ponytail and dons a sterile glove in his work environment.

Chris's presence in an engineering class is a powerful corrective to the typical assumptions among young technically minded designers about disability. Not everyone is looking for a fix. 

Chris was game to collaborate, however, so he asked us to consider how he might perform a new, relatively inaccessible activity like rock climbing. He also challenged us to think hard about socket technology, which has been notoriously difficult to solve in all prosthetic limbs research—the fight against heat, moisture, and friction when machine parts meet flesh.
