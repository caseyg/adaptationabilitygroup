Dancer and choreographer Alice Sheppard approached us with an irresistible design brief: a large-scale ramp for dancing on stage. She contacted Sara in fall 2015, asking to collaborate, and the project found a home in an Olin course—not the usual test kitchen, Investigating Normal, but in an introductory physics class with professor Yevgeniya Zastavker. The challenge was to house the operations of the inclined plane, or ramp, in an expressive physics—an exploration of its resistance, acceleration, and its affordances not for access, but for choreography. 

Alice came to campus in March for what we're calling at Olin a "micro-residency"—suited to our scale (350 students total!). She gave an artist's talk, and we audited the built environment of our campus to test its many ramped conditions for maximum speed, Alice's preferred movements, banking, and so on.
