The [Accessible Icon Project](http://accessibleicon.org/) is an open-source, ongoing work of social design and activism. Co-founded by Sara Hendren and [Brian Glenney](http://www.brianglenney.com/) in 2011, and later joined by [Tim Ferguson Sauder](http://www.asmallpercent.com/) and [Triangle, Inc.](http://triangle-inc.org/), the project starts with a [free icon](http://accessibleicon.org/#use) in the public domain and continues its work connecting with advocates and initiatives for disability rights and inclusion all over the world. Read the full story on the [project web site](http://accessibleicon.org/). 

The following are some images from the project's early days, its later iteration as formal design, and some events and partnerships. You can also see more on [social media](https://www.facebook.com/accessibleicon).
