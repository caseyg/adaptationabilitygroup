Co-founded by Sara Hendren and [Brian Glenney](http://www.brianglenney.com/) in 2011, and later joined by [Tim Ferguson Sauder](http://www.asmallpercent.com/) and [Triangle, Inc.](http://triangle-inc.org/), the project starts with a [free icon](http://accessibleicon.org/#use) in the public domain, which is now being used in thousands of places all over the world for free. and continues its work connecting with advocates and initiatives for disability rights and inclusion all over the world. Read the full story on the [project web site](http://accessibleicon.org/).
