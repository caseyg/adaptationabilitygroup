We're working as a satellite site of the [Adaptive Design Association](http://www.adaptivedesign.org/), a New York City non-profit that builds accessible, low tech adaptive furniture and devices for young people. 

After Sara took the three-day intensive course in New York City and did independent research and training with its counterpart, the Assistive Device Center at the Perkins School for the Blind, ADA invited the a+a lab to form local partnerships of our own—to spread these basic fabrication techniques, but mostly to foster a disposition toward human difference and atypicality: a disposition of affordable materials, customized adaptation, and molding the world for individuals, not at scale.

ADA director Alex Truesdell, who got her start in occupational therapy at Perkins, came to visit Investigating Normal in the spring 2015 class. She introduced students to the history of ADA's work and client-partners, spoke about the incredibly robust properties of a humble technology like triple-wall cardboard, and walked students through some basic techniques.

ADA and Perkins both deliberately create workshops that are radically democratized, on purpose: they use the back handle of a spoon for scoring folds, and sharp kitchen knives for some of the cuts, and simple wooden dowels for nails. (And band saws, and jigsaws, and clamps and glue.) It's designed to be a place for anyone to access with an idea for altering or replacing the designed products we typically receive from mass manufacturing streams.

That means that a student or anyone in her ecology of care can have an idea, try something out, see what works; a parent, a teacher, a clinician, anyone. And the materials and labor—robust but affordable, and quick to assemble—mean that missteps and failures aren't catastrophic. How can you tell if a young person who's non-verbal and has complex mobility constraints will respond well to a chair or support structure? You can try it out and see, build to learn, start over if needed.

Students are invited to see this work *as engineering,* no more and no less. It's powerful to include low tech devices under the same engineering canopy with robotics, circuitry, and code. Engineering is for people, and so often the elegant, just-enough solution is one that people are asking for. One they can then alter and change and adapt as needed.  

The basics of cardboard carpentry are now a standard part of [Investigating Normal](http://aplusa.org/courses/investigating-normal/), where students are invited to look around their own built environments and find a mismatch for their own bodies or preferences. It's another powerful embodiment of engineering for everyone: locating oneself in the human continuum of needs.

In the spirit of ADA, students in the spring 2015 class worked with the Walker School in Needham to design some fabric coverings for classroom chairs to make them sensory havens—spaces of protection and calm, without possibility for injury. Like a private cave as a respite, with simple materials. They're designed for students who have sensory processing disorders that may result from psycho-social challenges or atypicality on the autism spectrum.
