We're working as a satellite site of the [Adaptive Design Association](http://www.adaptivedesign.org/), a New York City non-profit that builds accessible, low tech adaptive furniture and devices for young people. 

After Sara took the three-day intensive course in New York City and did independent research and training with its counterpart, the Assistive Device Center at the Perkins School for the Blind, ADA invited the a+a lab to form local partnerships of our own—to spread these basic fabrication techniques, but mostly to foster a disposition toward human difference and atypicality: a disposition of affordable materials, customized adaptation, and molding the world for individuals, not at scale.

ADA director Alex Truesdell, who got her start in occupational therapy at Perkins, came to visit Investigating Normal in the spring 2015 class. She introduced students to the history of ADA's work and client-partners, spoke about the incredibly robust properties of a humble technology like triple-wall cardboard, and walked students through some basic techniques.

ADA and Perkins both deliberately create workshops that are radically democratized, on purpose: they use the back handle of a spoon for scoring folds, and sharp kitchen knives for some of the cuts, and simple wooden dowels for nails. (And band saws, and jigsaws, and clamps and glue.) It's designed to be a place for anyone to access with an idea for altering or replacing the designed products we typically receive from mass manufacturing streams.

The basics of cardboard carpentry are now a standard part of [Investigating Normal](http://aplusa.org/courses/investigating-normal/), where students are invited to look around their own
