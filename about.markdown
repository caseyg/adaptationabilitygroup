welcome-text: The adaptation + ability group is a lab for creative research on technology
  + the body at [Olin College](http://olin.edu).
subhead: "**We&apos;re interested in** the encounters between humans and the built
  environmentâ€”especially when there&apos;s a mismatch between standardized design
  and the atypical body or mind. But we&apos;re also interested in critical questions
  about the future of the body: What counts as normal?  \n\nRead on to meet our group,
  or take a look at the  [**guidelines that drive our work**](http://aplusa.org/#manifesto).\n"

  bio: |
    **Toni Saylor** is a mechanical engineering major in her final year at Olin. She became interested in the a +a field her freshman year as she worked with an older adult community partner in a design course called Engineering for Humanity. Since then she has worked on many projects in and out of class related to aging and ability and focused around prosthetics. She just wrapped a year doing prosthetics and design research for Sara as a Clare Boothe Luce scholar.

  bio: "[**Annabel Consilvio**](http://aconsilvio.github.io/) is a junior studying
    software product design at Olin College of Engineering.  She focuses on projects
    in the realm of accessibility and is specifically interested in how access is
    approached in upcoming technologies.  She has worked as a front-end developer
    on a design team at IBM Design, on web development for an after school program
    in Mississippi, and on collaborative design for the future of local, organic farming
    in Massachusetts.  In her free time, she likes to bake and play board games. \n"

  bio: "[**Lauren Froschauer**](http://adaptivedesignstudyolincollege.blogspot.com/),
    Olin '16 lab alum,  works for Northrop Grumman as a Mechanical Engineer. She has
    been exploring Adaptive and Assistive Design for several years. In the summer
    of 2015, she trained at the Adaptive Design Association in New York, learning
    how to use affordable, ubiquitous, easily handled materials (mostly cardboard)
    to make adaptive devices. During her senior year at Olin, she designed and conducted
    an independent study in Adaptive and Assistive Design,  volunteering at Perkins
    School for the Blind in their Assistive Devices Center, creating cardboard chairs
    and desks for students attending the school. She also built a new partnership
    for the lab with Newman Elementary, a Needham elementary school. See more in our
    Reports section ."
