subhead: "**We&apos;re interested in** the encounters between humans and the built
  environment—especially when there&apos;s a mismatch between standardized design
  and the atypical body or mind. But we&apos;re also interested in critical questions

  #people) or [take a look at the **guidelines that drive our work**](#manifesto).\n"
